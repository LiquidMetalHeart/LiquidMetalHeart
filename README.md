- 👋 Hi, I’m @LiquidMetalHeart
- 👀 I’m interested in many things. The potential of AI is pretty cool.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing an electrical apprenticeship and want to move into the industrial automation space, but I have an interest in free software, and want to learn to code for my own DIY projects.
- 💞️ Right now I’m looking to collaborate on building a FOSS framework for an AI-powered kitchen assistant.
